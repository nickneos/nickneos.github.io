A few months ago I started experiencing issues with my Home Assistant setup on Raspberry Pi 3 model B. It appeard to be due to SD card corruption which is a common issue.

I had been thinking for a while to migrate my Home Assistant setup over to my home media server (HP Microserver Gen8) running Debian 10. This finally gave me the push to look into running Home Assistant via a Docker Container on Debian.

## Thoughts after running HA Core in Docker for a few months

It's been several months now of running Home Assistant Core in docker on my HP Microserver and I have to say, it is much faster and responsive than it was on my Raspberry Pi (more than I was expecting). 

The limits of the Pi 3 hardware really became noticable after adding many addons in Hass OS. However with my installation on docker (which has no add ons - I'll get to this later), I am running 16 docker containers and everything feels much smoother. My server has 16gb RAM, dual core processor, so it's no suprise really. 

However there are a few negatives. Running Home Assistant inm your own docker environment is technically [Home Assistant Core](https://www.home-assistant.io/faq/ha-vs-hassio/). It is not the complete OS that you get when installing via the normal Raspberry Pi methods as it's intended to be run on various operating systems. So you don't get the `supervisor` option in Home Assistant or (more importantly) the ability to install addons. 

However, this isn't that much of a big deal when you realise most addons (all the ones I was using) can be installed in docker pretty easily. You can search for downloadable docker containers at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). Admittedly, it is a bit more effort configuring the `docker-compose.yml` file for each container you want to add (I'll get to this later), as opposed to just clicking a button to download an addon. But once you get the hang of it, it's no big deal.


## Installing on Docker

Here I will share the steps I took for anyone looking to migrate to their own installation on docker.

The official guide is [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/docker/), but I will dive into a bit more detail.

Some things to keep in mind:

* This was done on Debian 10 but the steps should be similar for Ubuntu and possibly other linux distributions.
* Your addons requirements may be different to mine. The most important ones I needed to make sure existed on docker (which I cover in this guide) are:
    * [Appdaemon](https://hub.docker.com/r/acockburn/appdaemon/)
    * [Mosquitto MQTT Broker](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto)
    * [MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb)

There are several others I use too, but for keeping this guide simple I'll just cover those 3. It should give you an idea of how it works. But if you need help with any others, feel free to drop a comment at the end of the post and I'll see if I can help out ðŸ™‚


## Backing up existing HA config files

If you don't want to setup your HA config from scratch, copy everything from the `/config` folder on your Pi over to a usb or PC so you can later paste this over to your new HA setup on docker.

## Installing Docker

First thing is to install Docker on your system if you don't have it already. We'll do all this in a terminal.

Install the pre-requisite packages:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common 
```

Add the Docker GPG key:

```bash
DIST=debian   # change to ubuntu if using ubuntu
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/$DIST/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

Add the apt repository for docker:
```bash
add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/$DIST $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```

Install the docker engine
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y
```

You can now verify docker is installed by running the below:
```
docker version
```

## Installing Docker Compose

Docker Compose is technically not needed, however it makes it much easier configuring, maintaining and starting up multiple containers. 

To install run the following:

```bash
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.5/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

To verify its been installed you can run:

```bash
docker-compose --version
```

## Configuring Docker

With docker installed, we should configure a few things.

#### Start docker on boot

```
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

#### Add user to docker group
We should add the user that will be running docker commands to the docker group, so that the user has the necessary permissions to execute docker commands.

Replace `username` with your system user:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker username
```

#### Setup Environment Variables for Docker

I recommend creating some system wide variables, which can be used in the docker compose file.

Replace `1000` with the UID and GID of the user that will be running docker. Usually its 1000, but to check run `id -u username` and `id -g username` replacing username with your username

Replace `Australia/Melbourne` with your timezone as formatted [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
``` bash
echo PUID=1000 | sudo tee -a /etc/environment
echo PGID=1000 | sudo tee -a /etc/environment
echo TZ=Australia/Melbourne | sudo tee -a /etc/environment
```

Now reboot your system for good measure

## Setting up docker-compose file

Now the fun stuff.

Firstly, let's create a docker folder. This will create it in your home folder, but you can have this where ever you want. Just make sure any commands where I reference this folder you update accordingly:

```bash
mkdir ~/docker/
```

And folders for each of our containers to be used later

```bash
cd ~/docker/
mkdir -p ./homeassistant/config/
mkdir -p ./homeassistant/config/appdaemon  # if installing appdaemon
mkdir -p ./docker/mosquitto/               # if installing mosquitto
mkdir -p ./mariadb/db/                     # if installing mariadb
```

Now create a file called `docker-compose.yml` by executing the command `nano docker-compose.yml`

Add the below into the file. Remove any parts for containers you don't want to install, and take note of any comments requiring you to update values such as IP Addresses, passwords, etc.

Note that since this is a yaml file, indentation is important. Also note how we are using the environment variables (`TZ`, `PUID` and `PGID`) we created earlier throughout this file.

```yaml
version: '3.3'
services:
  homeassistant:
    container_name: home-assistant
    image: homeassistant/home-assistant:stable
    volumes:
      - ~/docker/homeassistant/config:/config
    environment:
      - TZ=${TZ}
    restart: always
    network_mode: host
    depends_on:
      - mariadb    # remove this if not installing mariadb
      - mosquitto  # remove this if not installing mosquitto

  # remove this block if not installing appdaemon
  appdaemon:
    container_name: appdaemon
    ports:
      - 5050:5050
    restart: always
    environment:
      - 'HA_URL=<your HA_URL value>' # eg. http://192.168.1.2:8123
      - 'TOKEN=<your TOKEN value>'   # Long-Lived Token from Home Assistant
      - 'DASH_URL=http://$HOSTNAME:5050'
    volumes:
      - ~/docker/homeassistant/config/appdaemon:/conf
      - ~/docker/homeassistant:/homeassistant
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    image: acockburn/appdaemon:latest
    depends_on:
      - homeassistant
  
  # remove this block if not installing mosquitto
  mosquitto:
    container_name: mosquitto
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 1883:1883
    volumes:
      - ~/docker/mosquitto:/mosquitto
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    image: eclipse-mosquitto

  # remove this block if not installing mariadb
  mariadb:
    container_name: mariadb
    image: mariadb
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ~/docker/mariadb/db:/var/lib/mysql
    ports:
      - 3306:3306
    environment:
      - PUID=${PUID}
      - PGID=${PGID}
      - TZ=${TZ}
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<password>  # change this to any password you want. Can remove this line after initial setup
```

Some things worth calling out:
* `volumes:` allows you to persist data between the container and host machine. Eg. `~/docker/homeassistant/config:/config` maps `~/docker/homeassistant/config` on the host machine to `/config` in the home assistant container. So in other words, to access `/config` in Home Assistant, go to `~/docker/homeassistant/config` on your host machine
* `restart: always` ensures the conainer always restarts if it stops. If it is manually stopped, it is restarted only when Docker daemon restarts or the container itself is manually restarted.
* `depends_on:` allows you to specifiy dependencies between containers.

I also recommend adding [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/), which is a container that lets you manage all your containers via a webui. 

Add the below to the `docker-compose.yml` file for inluding Portainer:

```yaml
  portainer:
    image: portainer/portainer
    container_name: portainer
    restart: always
    command: -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock
    ports:
      - 9000:9000
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ~/docker/portainer/data:/data
    environment:
      - TZ=${TZ}
```

Now for the magic. To spin up all those containers we defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, just run the following:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To check everything is running, you can execute `docker ps` in a terminal. You can also execute commands like `docker stop container_name` or `docker restart container_name`, etc. 

However it is much easier to do all this via portainer. Simply go to `http://IP_ADDRESS:9000` on a web browser (replace IP_ADDRESS with the ip address of the machine you're running docker on) and after logging in, click on containers on the left menu bar to bring up all your container. Clicking on one of those containers bring up a number of options and stats.

## Verifying your HA Installation

You can now log in to Home Assistant via `http://IP_ADDRESS:8123` and setup your HA from scratch. 

If you backed up you `/config` folder at the start of this guide, stop the HA docker container either in portainer, or by executing `docker stop homeassistant`. Then copy over your `/config` contents over to `~/docker/homeassistant/config/`. Now you can start HA again either in portainer or by executing  `docker start homeassistant`. 

Verify everything got migrated over at `http://IP_ADDRESS:8123`. 

## Some additional settings for specific docker containers

#### Mosquitto

To use the Mosquitto MQTT broker with Home Assistant, it is advisable to setup a user and password on the MQTT broker.

Ensure mosquitto is running and enter the shell of the mosquitto container:

```bash
docker start mosquitto
docker exec -it mosquitto /bin/sh
```

You should now be in the mosquitto container's shell and can run below commands within the actual container.

First we will setup user/password authentication for the MQTT broker (this will be the login details we will use for connecting HA to this MQTT broker). Replace \<username\> to any username you desire:

```bash
mosquitto_passwd -c /mosquitto/config/passwd <username>
```
Then, you will be asked to enter a password and confirm it.

You can view the contents of the created file:

```bash
cat /mosquitto/config/passwd
# this should outpput in the format: <username>:<encrypted_password>
```

Now let's modify `mosquitto.conf` with some settings, including disabling annonymous login and using the above created user/password:

```bash
echo "persistence true" > /mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
echo "persistence_location /mosquitto/data/" >> /mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
echo "allow_anonymous false" >> /mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
echo "password_file /mosquitto/config/passwd" >> /mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
```

Now exit the mosquitto shell and restart mosquitto:
```bash
exit
docker restart mosquitto
```

In Home Assistant, you can now add the MQTT integration: [configuration] > [integrations] > [add] > [MQTT] and enter the IP address of the mosquitto container (should be the same as your Home Assistant IP), port is 1883, and the user and password you created above.

#### MariaDB

We need to create a user and database on MariaDB for Home Assistant to use as its database backend.

Ensure MariaDB is running and enter the shell of the MariaDB container:
```bash
docker start mariadb
docker exec -it mariadb /bin/bash
```

Connect to the MariaDB server via mysql client with the root user. When prompted, enter the password you specified in `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

You should now be connected to the mysql console. Run the following SQL commands one at a time. In this example I am using the username `ha_user` and password `my_strong_password`. Change as needed:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE homeassistant;
CREATE USER 'ha_user' IDENTIFIED BY 'my_strong_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON homeassistant.* TO 'ha_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'my_strong_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON homeassistant.* TO 'ha_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'my_strong_password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit
```

That takes care of what is needed on MariaDB side. We can now exit the MariaDB shell:
```bash
exit
```

Now we can modify our Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` by adding the below (make sure you change the \<IP_ADDRESS\> part.):

```yaml
recorder:
  db_url: 'mysql://ha_user:my_strong_password@<IP_ADDRESS>:3306/homeassistant?charset=utf8'
```
Restart Home Assistant, and it should now be using MariaDB SQL backend for its database. Keep an eye on Home Assitant logs (eg. via `tail -f ~/docker/homeassistant/config/home-assistant.log`) in case any errors about connecting to MariaDB come up.

## Updating HA and other containers

To update the home assistant container to the latest version as new versions come out, I run the below:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker-compose pull homeassistant

# Recrate the docker container using latest image
docker-compose up --build -d homeassistant

# Delete old docker images
docker image prune -f
```

For updating other docker containers, replace `homeassistant` above with the name of the docker service you want to update (eg. appdaemon, mosquitto, mariadb, etc). Or you can leave out this part completely and it will update all docker containers.
