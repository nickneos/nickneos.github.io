To help beginner coders submit their pull requests, I created a webpage of [IT memes](https://www.nickneos.com/IT-Memes/).

Submit a meme to the [repo](https://github.com/nickneos/IT-Memes) via Pull Request by following the instructions in the [ReadMe](https://github.com/nickneos/IT-Memes/blob/main/README.md) and it will count towards your PR's!
