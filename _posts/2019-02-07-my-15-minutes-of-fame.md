I've been taking part in the Myki Android trial the past week and I'm really eager for this to be official rolled out. 

For those that don't know, Myki is the smart card ticketing system used for electronic payment of fares on most public transport services in Melbourne and regional Victoria.

The Myki Android Trial is a beta rollout of loading your Myki via the Google Pay app on your Android smartphone and using your smartphone to "tap" on and off at train stations, buses, etc. 

I shared some comments on reddit in a thread asking for people's experiences, and yesterday while on my lunch break I had a reporter from [The Age](http://www.theage.com.au) private message me if I was willing to chat about my experience. I called him and we had a chat. 

Later he asked if I was willing to have some photos taken of me tapping my phone at a terminal. So there I was later that afternoon on a tram being snapped by a photographer from The Age!

Definitely wasn't expecting any of this as I was heading to the office that morning!
