<!-- # Who am I?

Welcome to my website! My name is Nick Neos and I am a full time data engineer with interests in photography, DJing and Home Automation. I am active in the [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) community.

On this site I will showcase some of my interests. I also maintain a blog on this site which I will post to from time to time. -->
